            <p>The design architecture of social media platforms and recommendation algorithms are making it easier to promote extreme polarizing content and antagonistic behavior.
              Secure by design is a series of design, policy and technological recommendations and considerations to ensure user security and moderate content across platforms.

      <p>Language is weaponized and is used as a means to inflict violence. Anonymity is a facilitating factor in the spread of harassment.
      More often than not, hate speech and online harassment are protected by free expression. As baseless conspiracies, polarizing statements, 
      false ideas and offensive commentary infiltrate our social media, the impending question is what are the measures that are being taken to tackle
      this problem? The following are some initial experiments conducted to develop user understanding, evaluate exisiting interventions, and ideate 
      alternative/additional solutions.

     <div class="container-5"> PERSPECTIVE AI </div>

      <div class="project-description-ii"> 
      <p>Perspective AI is and API developed to detect hate speech and to be used in content moderation. I conducted a few experiments to see <br>
        <br> <span> ▸ </span> What is considered as hate speech? 
        <br> <span> ▸ </span> Whate are its limitations?
        <br> <span> ▸ </span> How easy is it to evade the algorithm and deliver hateful content?  ‍</p>
      
      <p><br>I hinted at race & sexuality, used intentional type glitches, misogynistic/hateful lyrics from pop music to evaluate the API.

    <div class="container-5"> HUMAN VS AI </div>

     <div class="project-description-ii"> 
     <p>I conducted a survey using comments scraped from dataset used to build the content moderation algorithms
        to see if humans could agree on what was hate speech and what was not. The researched comments were then compared with how an AI tool would rate it. The key findings from
        this experiment was <br>
       <br> <span> ▸ </span> Out of the 30 respondants there were a lot of conflicting opinions on what was hate speech, offensive speech and what wasn't harmful.
       <br> <span> ▸ </span> AI predictions partially aligned with human sentiment on the topic.
       <br> <span> ▸ </span> How easy/ is it to evade the algorithm and deliver hateful content?  ‍</p>
     
     <p><br>Note: All the scraped comments were categorized as a form of hate speech/offensive speech.
