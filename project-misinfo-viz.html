            <p>Today, misinformation is challenging our information ecosystem on an unprecedented scale. To solve this problem we need to improve the way we understand misinformation. 
            This project is an interactive data-visualization tool designed to increase accessibility to misinformation data in India.

      <p>The impact of misinformation on the information ecosystem is severe and challenging. 
        Conspiracy theories, fake news, disinformation campaigns, manipulated media, and deep fakes have continued to 
        challenge information ecosystems. Social media technologies use algorithms that have prioritized engagement over
        accuracy of information. Critical disinformation studies has aided in contextualizing, measuring and mitigating misinformation. 
        Currently, research in this area has been primarily focused on the global north. The issue in India has led to mob killings, 
        suppression of movements and more.voices. 
      <br>
      <br>The systems map of the information ecosystem tries to demystify the complexity of misinformation. It tries to break down 
      misinformation to identify where design interventions can help curb the spread in India. The goal was to understand how different 
      players in the misinformation landscape and their role in the misinformation sphere. </p>

      <p>Misinformation is shared intentionally and unintentionally 
        by people among their networks. A survey was designed to understand people's attitudes, reactions and opinions on misinformation. The survey was followed 
        by an interview to provide a holistic understanding of the current landscape amongst the public that is both quantitative and qualitative.
        <br>

        <div class="container-5"> MAIN CHALLENGES </div>
     
        <div class="project-description-ii"><p> The research revealed high rates of acceptance (77%) towards encountering misinformation. 
          The largest market for Facebook and WhatsApp is India. Whatsapp (53.1%), which is one of facebook's entities was observed to be widely used for new consumption, 
          followed by Youtube (35.7%).
          <br>
          <br>Respondents shared with high frequency that they were exposed to misinformation and fake news. Even then, they found it difficult to 
          recall their point of exposure. Even with awareness people find it difficult to meticulously identify if the information that they consume is true or false. 
          People heavily rely on fact checkers to verify their information.
          <br>
          <br>Misinformation is unstructured and communities face difficulty identifying their point of exposure. 
          Individual biases make people susceptible to believing and amplifying misleading content. Solving problems starts with gaining comprehension of the 
          available information but social media platforms rarely provide data while playing a massive role in amplifying misinformation which limits our understanding of the topic.

              Misinformation is a complex problem area, there are two main problems that I'm trying to address through this project. Gaining access to misinformation data and increasing the comprehension around misinformation. The identified 
              audience that'd benefit from this are researchers, designers, technologists, cautious information consumers, and users who want to be more aware.
